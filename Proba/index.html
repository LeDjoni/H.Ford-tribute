     <p> <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/henry-ford-biography-1991814"  target="_blank"> Henry Ford</a> was born in 1863 on a farm in rural Michigan,  near Detroit. From an early age, he expressed an interest in mechanical devices. He was given a pocket watch at the age of 15, and he developed a reputation for being an experienced watchmaker.</p>
<p>
Shortly after his mother passed away, Henry left the family farm to seek employment in Detroit. He worked his way up to becoming an engineer at the Edison Illuminating Company. By 1893 he had become chief engineer and gained the recognition and encouragement of Thomas Edison. Henry Ford retained a deep affection for Thomas Edison throughout his life.</p>
<p>
It was working as chief engineer at Edisonâ€™s that he was able to work on a petrol drive quadricycle. His testing was successful, and this enabled him to develop the quadricycle into a small car; this proved the basis for the famous Model T motor car introduced in 1908. The Ford Motor company was formed in 1903 with the backing of $28,000 from various investors. </p>
